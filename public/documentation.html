        The myFlix application is a movie API designed for movie enthusiasts who want to access information about movies, 
        directors, and genres. The application will be hosted online and is responsive, so it can be used anywhere and on 
        any device, providing all users with the same experience. Users can receive information on movies, directors, and 
        genres to learn more about the movies they've watched or are interested in. Additionally, users can create a profile
         to save data about their favorite movies. The API is developed with Node.js and Express, uses MongoDB for the database, 
         and Mongoose to model the business logic. The API provides movie information in JSON format and includes features such as 
         authentication, authorization, and data validation. MyFlix is tested with Postman and the source code is deployed 
         on a publicly accessible platform like GitHub, while the API is deployed on Heroku.
